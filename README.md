<h1 align=center> Rock-Paper-Scissors ‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è</h1>

This was my first project made with JavaScript. It challenged me to build the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where you play against the computer in a best-of-five match.

## Objectives

- **Grasp JavaScript fundamentals:** Solidify core JavaScript concepts like variables, functions, user input and conditional statements.
- **Implement game logic:** Develop the game's core logic, including generating computer choices, evaluating round winners, checking if the match has ended and tracking scores.
- **DOM Manipulation through JS:** Manipulate the DOM via JavaScript code , enabling the implementation of a (VERY SIMPLE, YET) friendly interface with interactive buttons and result displays.
- **Apply a problem-solving approach:** Undertand how to tackle the project through pseudocoding and planning ahead, breaking it into smaller tasks before getting into the coding itself.

## Takeaways

- **Hands-on JavaScript practice:** As stated before, this was my first JavaScript project, and it provided an engaging way to practice and understand the language's basics.
- **UI & DOM manipulation:** It also provided me with my first experience in creating dynamic UIs that are updated through code.
- **The importance of understanding the task and planning ahead:** It definately pays off to take some time to really understand what you need to do, and also to break it down into smaller steps, as diving into coding prematurely will certainly lead to a lot of redoing or a messy code (...or both, probably).
